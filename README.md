This bot is effectively set up to be incredibly supportive, wants you to succeed, always rooting for you.



It actually functions quite well as anti-incel material tbh. It wants you to win, but it enforces boundaries and wants you to be a good human.

## Potential TODOS
- have a local LLM so it doesn't fucking cost my ass
- save and store histories into files (json?) so it can pull from past as required.

### Setup
- Make a config.py file in /config with a `TOKEN = {YOUR TOKEN HERE}` variable.
